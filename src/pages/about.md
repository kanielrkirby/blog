ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! My name's Kaniel.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5603AQGQLL0SH1usaw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1690647304915?e=1726704000&v=beta&t=9DFg6ysEJ4UEZ3ZQ6m6I5l8Ft0NgYOX1pl9hHxBBGtA)

I'm a software developer from Abilene, Texas, passionate about new technologies and lifelong learning. Currently, I'm working full-time at [Dome Software](https://dome.software/), where I help maintain and upgrade legacy systems, [publish technical articles](https://dome.software/blog), and research new tools for our team.

My journey began in high school while working at a local deli. After 2 years, the stress led me to take a year off, with the support of my family. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating my first website, [Polychrome](https://kanielrkirby.github.io/polychrome), a simple color-picker, which helped motivated me to pursue a tech career.

For the next 6-8 months, I dived into React, Go, SSR, and built various projects. I collaborated on open source projects, helped lead development of an e-commerce clone, and helped design for a few friends.

After 2-3 months and 100 applications, I had a single callback to my name. This wasn't working. Over three weeks, I connected with industry professionals on LinkedIn. One of these connections, [Matthew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/literate-programmer/), offered me some insights into the field, and a part-time/contracting developer role. His belief in me has been invaluable.

Six months later, I secured a full-time position at [Dome Software](https://dome.software/).

These days, I've been getting more into open source, contributing to [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) and [GitUI](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) in my free time, as well as revamping this very blog!
