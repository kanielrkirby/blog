I've spent months in my developer journey wasting time 'ideating' instead of building. Here, I'll try my best to convince you why that's a bad idea.

## Introduction

I started software development about a year-and-a-half ago, and through that time, I realized that, after I had built up enough knowledge about the technologies I was using, the only way to progress was to build something. That has served me well, as in Novemember of 2022, I landed my first position as a developer.

Some advice I hear a lot lately is to build something that matters. Build something that solves a problem you have. And that's great advice, it really is. But it was wrong for me at the time. Let me explain.

## The Problem

I got into a rut after picking up my first job, because I had everything I needed: Money, time, and a decent social life. However, I haven't really been making much progress. I learn in the allotted time I get in a workday, and that's about it. The most that you'd get out of me off work is the *constant* tweaking of my configuration files (by the way, [please don't do that](/stop-tweaking-config-files)).

## Some People Just Need to Start

The fact is, many newer developers aren't building apps anymore. Maybe they found other things to keep them busy, or they just don't feel inspired.

For me, I was discouraged by all the advice I had heard before. "Why build an app if it's already been built?" "I don't have any problems that need solving right now." "I don't have anything ***good enough*** to show real users."

And all of that makes enough sense in the moment, but what it results in is someone who hasn't engaged in active programming and learning, trying to find problems to solve. That is, people who aren't running into problems anymore, looking for problems.

It's hard to come up with unique, important, and relevant problems when you haven't touched a non-work codebase in 3 months. And I suppose that's what I'm getting at. The truth is, at a certain point, it really doesn't matter what you build. Is the only thing you can think of building a notes app, but you can't justify building yet another? Well, this is me giving you permission. Go wild. Build the s#!t app. Spend 3 months working on it in your free time. Make it ***perfect*** for you.

## The Problem Isn't Your App Choice

Any app can be interesting. Maybe your notes app is the fanciest, most stylistic notes app on the market. Maybe you provide first-class support for NeoVim. Maybe your notes app is the most scalable, yet still self-hostable solution for internal business notes. What do ***you*** want out of it?

## The Point Isn't to Be the Next Obsidian / NeoVim

It's okay to start a personal project just for fun and learning. You don't need a better justification to build something. Learning ***is*** a justification. Building something that perfectly suits your needs is a fine motivation.

## Maybe You Don't Need to Build an App

A fully-fledged one at least. While I think there are several benefits that come from bringing concepts to a place of finality and polish, maybe you can start with something more digestible, like a micro-app. Just starting enough to get the concept, play around with it, and show off to someone. This can provide you with a lot of fun, new concepts, and if you take a liking to one, you can expand it!

## Conclusion

You're allowed to build a crappy, proof-of-concept, cookiecutter app. Are ***you*** the one learning these concepts, and solving new problems yourself? That's the goal of all these things. Having fun, and gaining experience, so that when the right problems come your way, you're the one who can step up.

With countless YouTube videos, StackOverflow answers, [GitHub Copilot](/github-copilot-cheatsheet-2023), and most recently ChatGPT, it's more important than ever to really practice ***solving*** problems, rather than watching tutorials.

Please. Just build something. Anything.

That's all for this one! I'll leave some awesome resources to help you get started building again. Happy coding!

## Resources and Ideas

- Build Your Own X [Books](https://build-your-own.org/) and [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)
- [Awwwards Web Designs](https://www.awwwards.com/)
- Try building out a big application from scratch (Think Twitter, Google, etc.) Just try to avoid following tutorials to solve problems.
- Work with different [APIs](https://github.com/n0shake/Public-APIs)
- Try building an app without using any PaaS/SaaS/BaaS/IaaS.
- Try working with something like [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) to dip your toes into the desktop ecosystem.
