When I started programming, I wanted to learn everything. Sass? Drop everything. TypeScript? Why wasn't I using this already? Astro? I know three frameworks but I need better buttons.

That impulse came from discomfort - the feeling of not understanding something in my domain. And that discomfort was useful.

## The Comfort Zone

Eventually you settle into a stack. JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Redux, REST. When someone says "state management" you say "Redux." When someone says "formatting" you say "Prettier." Problems have solutions, solutions have tools, tools are familiar.

Then you hear about something outside your bubble. Docker. Raw SQL. Rust. Something you don't _need_ to understand to do your current job.

The logical response: why learn it? You're already effective with what you know. Learning new things takes time away from shipping features.

## The Problem

That logic is sound enough to be dangerous.

You don't _need_ to learn Golang, you already know JavaScript. You don't _need_ to know SQL, you already know Prisma. You don't _need_ to understand networking, the framework handles it.

Each excuse is individually reasonable. Collectively, they keep you in a shrinking bubble while the industry moves around you.

Worse: you stop encountering new perspectives. Everything looks like a nail because you only own hammers. Problems that don't fit your stack become someone else's problems.

## The Point

Discomfort is where learning happens. That uncomfortable feeling when you don't understand something? That's the signal to lean in, not away.

Software development isn't about memorizing how-tos. Anyone can Google "why won't my webhook fire" and find an answer from 2015. The hard part is having broad enough knowledge to know what tools exist, and creative enough thinking to apply them to problems that haven't been solved yet.

That breadth comes from repeatedly sitting with discomfort until it becomes familiarity. There's no shortcut.
