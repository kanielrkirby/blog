The feelings I was experiencing were tied to self-worth, to intelligence, to failure. I felt that I would never be worth anything, and that I was desperately trying to escape failure.

When I made a PR, I would spend hours on it, regardless of if it were a small fix, constantly tweaking and changing. I would say things like "What if they say this" over and over, not being able to focus on anything else. And eventually, I produced garbage code because of it. Because the only thing I was focused on was acceptance. And in the end, I got neither. I was told it was the wrong solution.

Software is really hard. You're never done learning, you're never done growing, and the moment you're comfortable with where you are, you by definition stop growing by any substantial amount.

Not only this, but there is a neverending pile of work. Work never stops, realistically. You take on task by task, from 9 to 5.

We prioritize, glamourize, and nearly worship at times, efficiency and productivity. These are not bad virtues by any means, and anyone who pursues them will likely find success in their craft. But I find them very limiting in terms of fulfillment and happiness.

I believe you can derive an amount of satisfaction from software, but meaning? I just don't know if that's what software was made for. We're here to make *other* people's meaning come alive. To fulfill *other* people's aspirations. And most of the time, you won't get to see the expression on their face when they actually see the feature *you* worked on. You'll see a Jira ticket go to the Done column before picking up another, just like it.

To get out of this inevitable rut of trudging through work tickets, I tried contributing to OSS. My goal was to pick up an issue, and take full ownership of seeing it through. I would research what I needed, and come up with a solution, with as little help as possible.

"What's the point? I'll never be a <em>real</em> developer"

Every once and a while, these sorts of thoughts get to me. I start to wonder if I've been wasting my time.

## The Cause

Software development is straightforward, in and of itself. You go to the office (or stay home, if you're one of the lucky few), pick up an issue, research it, test a few solutions, and push the changes. And I don't believe these things are what make it hard at all. We, by the definition of our craft, have access to thousands of resources, from search engines, to forums, to LLMs, and version control isn't the craziest thing, typically involving around 4 commands (`checkout`, `add`, `commit`, `push`).

No, what makes software development so difficult is the ecosystem, the culture, and money, and how these influence our minds fundamentally.

### The Ecosystem

With sites like [Killed By Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/), [Days Since the Last JS Framework](https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/), and [_](https://example.com), it doesn't take long to find out that the software space moves fast.

### The Culture

When you work for someone, be that in a traditional software job, a startup, or an open source project, you typically are expected to adopt and become part of their culture. This includes simple things, like how to format a commit message in Git, but it also includes complex things, like how to
