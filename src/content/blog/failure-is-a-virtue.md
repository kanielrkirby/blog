I used to tweak PRs for hours before submitting. "What if they say this?" I'd spiral, and my code quality declined alongside my mental health. After all that, the review came back: "This is not the right solution."

All that avoidance, same result.

## The Problem

Software development rewards iteration. Ship something, get feedback, improve. But when you're insecure about your work, you try to skip the feedback part by making everything perfect upfront.

This doesn't work. You can't anticipate every critique. You can't know what you don't know. And the longer you spend polishing in isolation, the more invested you get in the wrong direction.

The fear is that failure means inadequacy. The reality is that failure is information.

## The Trap

Avoiding criticism feels safe. If I never submit imperfect work, I never have to face the discomfort of being wrong in front of colleagues.

But this stunts growth. Discomfort is the catalyst - I've [written about this before](/posts/a-case-for-discomfort). By avoiding it, you rob yourself of the feedback that actually makes you better.

You also waste time. Hours spent pre-empting imaginary criticisms are hours not spent on the next thing. The perfect PR that took a week is worth less than two good-enough PRs that took three days total.

## What Helps

**Smaller iterations.** Submit earlier. Get feedback on direction before you're invested in implementation. A 30-minute check-in can save a week of wasted work.

**Ask sooner.** Especially in OSS or new codebases. The fear of looking dumb by asking is smaller than the cost of building the wrong thing. Most maintainers would rather answer a question than review a misguided PR.

**Reflect on past failures.** Not to beat yourself up - to extract the lesson. What signals did you miss? What would you do differently? Failure without reflection is just repetition.

## The Point

Failure isn't the opposite of success. It's the mechanism of learning. The goal isn't to avoid failure - it's to fail faster, cheaper, and with better information extraction.

I'm not great at this yet. But I'm getting better at being bad at things, which is sort of the whole point.
