## Introduction

AWS is a cloud platform. In modern terms, you can almost think of AWS as the "HuggingFace" of cloud computing. It is a platform that provides a huge collection of services that can be used to build applications, anything from storing images, videos, and files, to providing server functionality without the server, to managing and monitoring your applications and infrastructure.

AWS is a huge platform, and it can be overwhelming to get started. Personally, every time I opened up the documentation for a service, seeing a hundred different topics and subtopics, I would get overwhelmed and close the tab. I figure that I'm not that only one that's struggled with this.

So, I decided to write this article to give a brief overview of the services that AWS provides. I will try to keep it as high level as possible, and I will try to keep it as up to date as possible. I will also try to keep it as short as possible, but I make no promises.

## Storage

Storage is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of AWS. AWS provides a huge collection of storage services. Here are some of the most popular ones:

### S3

S3 is probably the first storage solution that a new developer learns exists when they explore all the options in AWS. It's cheap, easy to use, and flexible for a developer who may not have tons of money to blow on storage.

You can store just about anything in S3, from media, to files, to keys and values. It's a great place to store files that you want to be publicly accessible, like images, videos, and documents. It's also a great place to store files that you want to be private, like keys and values, or files that you want to be accessible only to certain users.

The thing that, I think, draws so many in to S3 is it's flexibility, in terms of payment. If you're a small to midsize company, and you need a quick and easy solution for your 1000 users, you can use S3. And I think that's a great selling point.

At larger scales, especially when you're dealing with millions of users, S3 can potentially get expensive, and you may want to look into custom solutions.

### DynamoDB

I think of DynamoDB as an alternative to Redis. It's a key-value store, and it's great for storing data that you want to be accessible quickly. It's also great for storing data that you want to be accessible to a large number of users.

### RDS

### EFS
