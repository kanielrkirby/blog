Accessibility is hard. Everyone wants to make their website accessible, but between educating developers of all of the things they need to be aware of and convincing management to spend the time and money to make it happen, ***sometimes it just never gets done***. Whether you're a developer in a large company, or a small business owner, you have a range of tools you can use to make your job easier. But first...

## What all is involved in making a website accessible?

Way too much to cover in a single blog post. Web Accessibility Specialists have salaries comparable to developers, and for good reason. As always though, perfection is the killer of progress, so don't let that stop you from making your website accessible. There are a few things that you can do to make your website accessible, even if you don't have a web accessibility specialist on your team.

### Semantic HTML

Making sure that your HTML is semantically correct is one of the most important things you can do to make your website accessible. This means using the correct HTML tags for the correct content. For example, using a `<button>` tag for a button, and not a `<div>` or `<span>`. This provides dozens of built-in accessibility features that you don't have to worry about.

### Color Contrast

Let's see for ourselves where the point of illegibility *really* is.

There are tools out there that can help you determine if your text has enough contrast, such as [WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Luckily though, this is built right into the WAVE extension provided by Pope Tech, meaning you see exactly where the problems are on even huge websites.

### Links

Links are the basis of the web. Imagine breaking the user's entire experience with just your website. That's what happens when you don't use links correctly. If you just say "Click" for a button, a person who uses a screen reader will be completely lost. Instead, you should provide a descriptive link, such as "Click here to learn more about our company". This makes it better for everyone, not just people who use screen readers.

### Images

Images are another important part of the web. They can be used to convey information, or just to make the website look nice. But if they're not done correctly, they can be very difficult to use. For example, if you have an image that has text in it, and you don't provide an alternative text, a screen reader will not be able to read the text. Another common pitfall is background images using unnecessary alt text. If you have a background image that is purely decorative, you should not provide an alt text. This is because screen readers will read the alt text, and if it's not necessary, it's just noise.

And so, so much more. But don't worry, Pope Tech covers all of this and more.

## What is Pope Tech?

Pope Tech is a web accessibility tool that helps you make your website accessible. It provides a variety of tools to help you make your website accessible. They provide issues under 6 different categories:

### Errors

These aren't just minor glitches; they're barriers that can prevent your website from being fully usable with assistive technology. Pope Tech helps identify and prioritize these crucial issues, guiding you towards a more functional and inclusive digital experience.

### Alerts

Sometimes a warning, sometimes a false alarm - these alerts are your heads-up to potential issues.

### Contrast

Visual accessibility is key. Poor contrast can render text virtually invisible for users with visual impairments.

### Structure

A well-structured website is like a well-organized book - it guides users effortlessly through the content.

### ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

In the realm of dynamic content and complex interfaces, ARIA attributes are vital. Pope Tech evaluates your use of ARIA, ensuring that your siteâ€™s interactive elements are accessible to everyone.

### Features

It's not just about fixing issues; it's also about recognizing what you're doing right. Pope Tech highlights your website's accessibility strengths, encouraging you to continue and expand on these practices.

## How does Pope Tech work?

Pope Tech is built on the WAVE engine, which is a web accessibility engine that was created by WebAIM. It's a very powerful engine that can detect a lot of issues. Pope Tech takes the WAVE engine and adds a lot of extra features on top of it. It provides a lot of extra information about the issues, such as how to fix them, and why they're important. It also provides a lot of extra features, such as the ability to create a report, and the ability to create a custom issue.

Something I've noticed and appreciated quite a bit when using Pope Tech is the in-depth explanations of the issues, and the entire classifications system, as well as the code snippets that show you exactly what the issue is, and how to fix it. It makes making these changes super quick and easy. It would not be nearly as feasible for our company to dedicate so many resources to accessibility for a clients if we didn't have technologies like Pope Tech.

## How can I get Pope Tech?

Pope Tech is a paid service, but they do offer free services as well, such as their public browser extension (WAVE), WebAIM's documentation, and their accessibility checklist. But if you want to use their full suite of tools, you'll have to pay for it. They offer a variety of plans, ranging from $25/month for basic services, to $225/month for support of over 1 million pages and unlimited users and websites.

## Conclusion

Pope Tech is a great tool that we've been using at [@domesoftware](https://www.linkedin.com/company/domesoftware) to make our clients lives easier. It provides a lot of great features that make it easy to find and fix issues. It's not a replacement for a web accessibility specialist, but it's a great tool to help you get started.
