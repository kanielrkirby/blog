## Motivation Isn't Magic

Neither is "manifestation", "the law of attraction", or any other buzzword you've heard. They're all just fancy ways of thinking about things to make yourself do it.

That's fine, I'm all for it. But personally, I just want to know what the real issue is, and how to fix it. That's all this article is about.

## The Real Issue

I can't possibly know the real issue is for you. But here's a couple guesses:

- You're in a rough patch.
- You're bored.
- You aren't seeing results.
- You don't know what you want.

These are all valid reasons to not be motivated. But they're also all fixable. Let's go through them one by one.

### You're in a Rough Patch

This is the only one that I can't really give advice on. Depression, anxiety, stress, etc., they're all real things that can affect your motivation. You should consider seeking help from a professional, though.

In the meantime, do your best to take care of yourself. Eat well, exercise, and get enough sleep, do things you enjoy.

### You're Bored

I like to think of boredom as a way of your brain telling you that you're not doing something you want to be doing. So, what do you want to be doing?

For example. I've had some projects in the past fall through that I had chalked up to "laziness" and "lack of motivation". In retrospect, I just knew that what I was doing wasn't bringing me any closer to my goals. So, motivation -> 0.

But there's ~an easy~ a simple solution. Figure out what you want, and do what aligns with that. Think of it as "manifestation" if you want.

### You Aren't Seeing Results

This problem can be a bit nuanced. Results take time, which can vary from person to person and goal to goal. The first step is doing some research and setting a realistic expectation for yourself. You still want to set a goal you can grow into, but setting the goal of "lose 100 pounds in a month" is just setting yourself up for failure.

The second step is to make sure you're doing the right things. You might be putting in 12 hours a day, but if you're not doing the right things, you're not going to see results. This is where research comes in. Look for people who have done what you want to do, and see what they did, talk to them, and learn from them.

### You Don't Know What You Want

You can't expect to have a ton of motivation when you don't know what you want. Your brain doesn't work that way. You need a direction, you need momentum. But I've found that the best way to figure out what you want is to try a bunch of things. Dive deep. Leave yourself a lot of time to think. Knowing what you want takes time. A lot of time.

## Conclusion

This article contains a lot of obvious advice, I know. But we often overcomplicate achieving our goals, in my opinion. I hope this article helped you in some way, and if it did, please share it with someone else who might need it!
