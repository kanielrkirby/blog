Is AI taking coding jobs? What is the current state of AI? Where are we headed? Here, I will give my best answers to these questions.

## What Really is AI?

I think defining it in an exact is the best way to start a discussion about it. What do you mean when you say AI? AGI? Machine learning? Neural networks? There are dozens of ways of interpreting it, and people use these terms almost interchangeably. It can make it hard to keep up when at one point, AI is a chess-playing computer, and the next it's a self-driving car. So, let's define some terms.

- **AI** - Artificial Intelligence. This is the broadest term. It refers to any computer system that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. I think of it as the umbrella term.
- **AGI** - Artificial General Intelligence. This is the term for a computer system that can perform any task that a human can at or above the level of a human. This is the "holy grail" of AI. It is the goal of much AI research today.
- **Machine Learning** - This is a subset of AI. It is a method of training a computer to perform a task without explicitly programming it to do so. It is a way of teaching a computer to learn from data. It is the most common way of creating AI today.
- **Neural Networks** - This is a subset of machine learning. It is a way of structuring a machine learning model. It is a way of structuring a computer to learn from data. It is the most common way of creating AI today.
