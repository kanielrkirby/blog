I've spent months in my developer journey wasting time 'ideating' instead of building. Here, I'll try my best to convince you why that's a bad idea.

## Introduction

I started software development about a year-and-a-half ago, and through that time, I realized that, after I had built up enough knowledge about the technologies I was using, the only way to progress was to build something. That has served me well, as in Novemember of 2022, I landed my first position as a developer.

Some advice I hear a lot lately is to build something that matters. Build something that solves a problem you have. And that's great advice, it really is. But it was wrong for me. Let me explain.

## The Problem

I got into a rut after picking up my first job, because I had everything I needed: Money, time, and a decent social life. However, it's recently come to my realization that I haven't really been making much progress lately. I learn in the allotted time I get in a workday, and that's about it. The most that you'd get out of me off work is the *constant* tweaking of my configuration files (by the way, [please don't do that](/stop-tweaking-config-files)).

That meant that I hadn't been *programming*. Solving problems, learning, developing applications. What problems did I have, if I was never programming?

## The Solution

The solution? Start programming again. Sure, maybe you don't need to build the umpteenth to-do application in React, but there are plenty of *interesting* projects that you can develop to get back into the groove of things (or just start in the first place) and, more importantly, start having / solving problems again. I think it's okay to build something that doesn't matter.

## Conclusion

Please. Just build something. Anything.
