Tweaking configs. Something I thought I would never do, I now spend hours a day doing. Why not, after all?

## Introduction

For context, I love tweaking config files. Finding the ***best*** way to do something, the ***new*** terminal commands like `rg` and `bat`, the ***newest*** plugins for NeoVim and VSCode. It's fun, and it seems like a productive use of time.

I'm here to dispute that last claim though, unfortunately.

## Why We Do It

First, let's talk about what's great about it. This part's pretty easy.

### Your Future Self Will Be More Productive

You're optimizing your setup so that future you is more effective, faster or more productive. If you use `bat`, you'll have an easier time reading out files from the CLI. If you use `markdown-preview-nvim` for NeoVim, you'll get to see your markdown before you end up posting it, and that can be useful. If you use `fzf`, you can find files super fast. These things are great for productivity.

### You Learn About Your Tools

Something I find important is learning how the tools you use every day work. You don't need to understand the exact implementation details, but knowing what an LSP is, how to navigate your system, and how to quickly search for things in it, will make your life a lot easier overall.

### It's Fun

What can I say? Sometimes it's relaxing to just sit there and make your setup perfect, customizing everything to be ***just*** for you.

## What's Wrong With It, Then?

Nothing's objectively wrong with spending some time working on your setup. The problem is when you blur the line between what constitutes as ***work***, rather than something you do for fun. Configuring your development server to support HMR (hot-module-reloading) can provide a substantial improvement to efficiency, while changing your entire configuration to make everything have the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) theme is.. well, fun.

And that's my point. I love spending time doing that. But it's a ***fun*** activity, not a ***work*** activity.

I'm not just talking about your 9-5, where you are ***paid*** to work (and obviously this would make sense to criticize). I'm talking about your ***free*** time. The time you dedicate to external coding projects. Are you spending the time on what you actually set out to do, or are you messing around with your NeoVim configuration so that `gcc` toggles comments?

## Conclusion

I don't want you to stop tweaking config files if you enjoy doing it, and like learning about NeoVim, VSCode, LSPs, command-line tools, etc. I simply want to ask you: Are you spending the time on what you planned on?
